# Brandon's Random Collection Of Tools That You Probably Shouldn't Use

The tools in this repository are scripts I've hacked together to perform basic
functions (control brightness, display system info, toggle color scheme
variants, etc). They've worked across a variety of machines under my control
(mainly Ubuntu/Arch Linux), so you might have success with them, but please
don't blame me if you run one of these programs and your dog inexplicably dies.

## TODO
- Utilize Go's wonderful test infrastructure to test these programs
- Add comments and reasonable documentation
