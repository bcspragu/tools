# SolarSwitch

I like the [Solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), but
sometimes I want to switch between dark and light ones depending on what the
world around me is like. Switching normally entails commenting out one color
and commenting in the next, and then going into my .vimrc and updating the
scheme there as well. This simple script just toggles between the two schemes,
and the changes take effect in the next opened terminal window.
